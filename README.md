# Music Recommendation System [Most Frequent Song] backend

## Overview

This project demonstrates the functionality of a modular Music Recommendation System, specifically focusing on the Most Frequent Choice (MFC) module. The system utilizes a dataset with 50 users and 100 songs to showcase how the MFC module selects the most frequently chosen songs after listening to a particular song.

## Functionality

- The MFC module:
  - Selects the most frequently chosen songs after the current song.
  - Randomizes the selection based on a predefined scheme.

- User Activity Simulation:
  - Utilizes a simulation module to mimic user activity.

## Demo

- To initiate the demonstration:
  - Click the "NEXT SONG" button on the demo page.
  - Observe the recommendation algorithm and user activity simulation in action.
